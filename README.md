# TokenLuncher-Airdrop
This code defines a Solidity smart contract that allows users to participate in an airdrop. The contract can distribute tokens for free or for a price, depending on the configuration of the contract. Users can purchase tokens using Ether or receive them for free, and there are limits on the number of tokens that each user can receive. The contract also performs checks on the availability of tokens and the approval of the sender for the transfer. Finally, there is a special discount for early investors.
